Document Text:

[Text of the uploaded document. (Is it feasible?)]

Analysis Instructions:

Focus on keywords such as "sale," "partition," "lease," or other terms that indicate the document's purpose.

Consider the structure and clauses typical of each document type, e.g., sale deeds often include transfer of ownership details.

Output Format:

Provide the document type in a JSON format as shown.

Example Response:

{{
  "document_type": "Sale deed"
}}

Example Use Case:

For a document detailing the transfer of property ownership, the output would be "Sale deed." For a document dividing property among heirs, it would be "Partition deed."

Note:

If the full text is too lengthy, include a concise summary that preserves key terms and context to aid accurate classification. The file content is:
